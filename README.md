# About
Valkyrie is an iconset designed for use in the Mellow Design Language. Our goal is to provide a highly-optimized set of icons that are custom made for Sippy and any future environments required. As such, Valkyrie will mostly include iconography related to basic UI (arrows, menu icons, etc.) and phone iconography (voicemail, call directions, etc.).
