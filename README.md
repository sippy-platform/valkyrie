# About
Valkyrie is an iconset designed for use in the [Meili](https://github.com/optimise-group/meili) front-end. Our goal is to provide a highly-optimized set of icons that are custom made for Meili and any future environments required for Sippy. As such, Valkyrie will mostly include iconography related to basic UI (arrows, menu icons, etc.) and phone iconography (voicemail, call directions, etc.).
